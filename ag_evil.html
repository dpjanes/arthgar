A good campaign is not all about picking daisies and handing out alms to the poor.
Here's a few reasons why Karish and Glimar were not winning popularity
contests.

After hearing John's explaination, I was tempted to place this in the
"Random acts of good" section. This session was played at John's cabin
sometime during the winter of 1984. My creativity may have been enhanced
somewhat during that evening.

	This was yet another incident in which the party was totally blameless.
In a small town to the North of the Tower, the name of which escapes me, we
decided to visit, with no ill intention having been formulatted prior
thereto. As background to the incident it is necessary to know that Karish
(after reading the Hobbit again) decided to create a belt purse that would
cry out "thief" if opened by any but him.
<p>
     We decided to enter a small establishment to break our morning fast.
After several hours of enjoying the company of the locals the bar had
become quite crowded, Karish's purse cried out "thief". Well, the bar being
so crowded with people, (Karish continues to blame this incident on the
barkeep for not abiding by even the most archaic fire safety standards),
was unable to ascertain who had pilfered something of his and said aloud
"Fire in the hole" which was fair warning to the party members to activate
whatever fire protection devices they had.  Short seconds thereafter the
room was engulfed by fire &shy; well, actually, the ground zero detonation of 6 3d6
fireballs, compliments of the Staff of Kings. Again, this was the fault of the
barkeep for not keeping crowd control, as Karish had no way in which to
identify the culprit by a discriminating <i>Disintegrate</i> or <i>Power Word</i>.
<p>
     Of course, the bar was starting to burn and people were
screaming and availing themselves of every exit. The party decided to vacate
the building, as we were not protected from failing debris. Karish even
forgot to attempt to recover what coin the thief had stolen. Shame on that.
<p>
     Once outside, we collected in front of the building. The Druid, whose
name I do not remember, but who was annoyed at the Tower, the Akars and the
rest of the nasty creatures we had in our employ  decided to avail himselves
of the opportunity to attack. Apparently he had been following us and this
town was under his protection. Fine job he was doing.
<p>
     (The context of the evening on which this session was played will
remain secret as some laws may have been bent, right Dave?)
[<i>A gentlemen never tells &shy; dpj</i>]
<p>
     Kevin had advised that a flaming chariot was streaking towards us from
a height at a great speed. The problem was we were in a wide street with no
cover. What to do? A somewhat incoherent voice (being that of a one David
Janes) calls out: "Cast a <i>Wall of Force</i> across the road". Brilliant!!!!.
<p>
     With haste this was done after much arguing, checking of spell times,
distances, etc., our spell was off bare seconds before the streaking inferno of
a chariot, with gleeful riders estatic at the prospect of riding down the
infamous Karish, Glimar and Daemon, crashed headlong into the <i>Wall of
Force</i>. Needless to say the Chariot of Sustarre was instantly annihilated and
the riders sent spinning through the air to tumble most humbly at our feet.
<p>
     Of course, of the three occupants, ony one, a fighter is stunned, the
Druid and another fighter are unhurt and combat ready. We lose the
initiative as we have to rush around the <i>Wall of
Force</i>. By this time the
Druid has summoned a fire elemental compliments of the burning building
which makes the DM laugh hahahaha. The fire elemental
interposes itself between Daemon and the Druid. "Hahahahahahaha," cries Daemon, "I
run through the fire elemental". "You'll be hit automatically for max damage,"
laughs the DM. "Hahahahaha," cries Daemon, "I don't care", as he leaps
through the fire elemental, to the dismay of the fighter and the Druid who
have looks on their faces of "These people are insane...."
<p>
     Within seconds the fighter is subject to multiple magic missles and an
arm loped off by the vorpal blade of Daemon. The Druid, seeing his cause and
soon his life will be wiped out, decided to flee. He quickly shape changes to
an eagle and gets the hell out of there. So ends the event.
<p>
     Once again it was the fault of the occupants of the town, as was the
case at the elvish town, that caused this unfortunate event. It was through
the lawful protection of property and the flagrant overcrowding of the bar
which lead to this result. We were blameless.

I have to add that I don't see our actions as particularly evil
in this particular case. I mean, we didn't even try to kill anyone.
We just wanted to have some fun in the spirit in interdenominational
(or perhaps interdemoninational) understanding.

We had learned through scrying that a Order of Paladins were
transporting an object of great significance. We intended to find out
what. We headed for a city (again can't remember the name damn we need
the southern map [<i>see <a href="ag_maps.html">maps</a></i>]).
Anyway we saw this procession headed along the street
while we flew along invisibly on the carpet and for fun decided to see
what was going on.
<p>
We landed on the roof of the building into which the procession was
entering. After several minutes of preparation (we were never ones to
enter a situation unless we have various globes, resistance, and detection
spells going) a human appeared up some stairs and we quickly subdued him.
On the top of the roof was a massive bell which we later discovered he
was coming to ring. Karish placed his <i>Explosion</i> spell on the bell (when
the bell was stuck it would explore causing damage in a 10' radius).
<p>
We then went down the stairs where we subdued 3-4 acolytes who were
tended an enormous rack of candles. We donned their clothing and
proceeded to watch the procession and the ceromonies taking place. We
then proceeded to start putting the candles out, several at a time. This
was noticed from down below as the candles had some significance for the
ceremony. Voices from below berrated us to keep the candles lit. We
continued our antics of lighting and putting out the candles. The voices
down below became more annoyed. Daemon and Glimar grabbed the rack and
decided to throw it down over the rail into the crowd. Just as we tipped
it over edge laughing, the cleric leading the ceremony turned and looked
up and too both our surprize it was the cleric we had been scrying upon.
Oops.
<p>
He screamed at the Paladins present to kill us, calling us...US evil...
He started chanting ..."Angel of.....come to our aid..." We didn't like
the sounds of that and decided to get out of there. We looked back and a
supernatural looking creature with wings had appeared and was headed out
way only to be intercepted by the Type V demon Karish though prudent to
summon upon hearing the word angle. We never stayed to see the outcome
of that battle. Onto the roof, on the carpet and then out of there.
<p>
I wonder how the old man made out with the bell afterward?

I thought it was very trendy these days in eco-circles to allow
fires to burn out of control. They call it natural forest management.
Karish was merely restoring the natural balance of things that
the Druids were neglecting in their tree-hugging arrogance.

Remember during our army ruling days Kevin had this big army of
orcs, ogres hill giants, trolls, human fighters and some minor MU's etc
marching against either us or someone we were helping (for pay of
course). Kevin was all happy because he thought (foolish him) that
Karish could only kill several hundred. Well Karish being Karish thought
long and hard (well for a few minutes anyway) and came up with an idea
to destroy the army. It's important to remember that we were playing
under the old Players Handbook.

He cast <i>Wall of Fire</i> in a ring at maximum distance. The old MU version
followed the MU, this was followed by a <i>Haste</i> spell and then a
<i>Polymorph Self</i> spell to eagle shape. Another important fact was this was
summer on a terrain of low hill, sparse trees but lots of shrubs and
grass.
<p>
So off flies Karish at 96" surrounded by a ring of fire. What a sight this
must have been to the hapless invaders. Cruising over the ground the
ring of fire paced over them twice in addition to starting natural
fires. Within minutes the air was full of flames and more importantly
smoke which clouded the air and filled their lungs. The poor trolls what
were they to do. Well burn of course. Stinging eyes and no air to breath
the army was some consumed. A pity. So ended another of Kevins glorious
plans against Karish.
<p>
In retrospect I believe this was one of the reasons why the Druid (see
the <i>Chariot of Sustarre</i> Incident) may have been mad, as the fire did
spead over a large area including further afield some forest.
