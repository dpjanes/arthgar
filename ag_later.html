These various stories come from the fourth phase of the campaign,
in the 1986 through 1988 period.

John adds the following note to many of these stories:
<i>Here's a few polymorph stories &shy; that were to Kevin's dissatisfaction.</i>

Then the habit of Karish using polymorph other on various creatures
to turn them into slugs, which he kept in a jar in his backpack. I had
hill giants, fire giants, black trolls, hydras, a white dragon, a medusa
and some other things. We were in a mess for a change fighting a bunch
of bone devils for some reason. Them and those silly fishing hook
weapons. What was Karish to do? Well throwing the jar of slugs in the
middle of them, followed by a dispel magic and a quick exit did help.
Although Glimar and I didn't wait around to see the results, I can just
imagine the confusion in that room.

<h2>The Purple Dragon</h2>

There's a lot more to be said about the Purple Dragon, and
I'll get it in here someday soon (I hope).

Then the failed attack on the Purple Dragon. Great plan but crappy
cross bow men. We simply had to have the mounds of treasure that the
Purple Dragon had. Karish turned a number of unwilling orcs (charmed)
into rot grubs. These loyal servants were then attached to crossbow
bolts anf fired at the Purple Dragon. One hit and he was dead meat with
a rot grub borrowing its way to his heart. Damned if all the orcs missed
before being engulfed by the Purple Dragon.
<p>
All was not lost as Rondo (a new monk character I had picked up---I
could be wrong on this, may have been later - but the death of the
Purple Dragon is correct) during the confusion ran in and attacked the
Purple Dragon with a <i>Dagger of Venom</i>. Stab and then we forced Kevin to
roll the save in front of us and wouldn't you know it he rolled a 1. Bye
Bye purple Dragon.
