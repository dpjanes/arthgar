...  Didn't John say that Daemon bit the big one?
He deserved it too, the Cyril MU murdering hairy stump thumper.

Gee, I don't recall how this happened :-) John, why don't you tell
the story again "for the record". I'm sure there's some sort of
misunderstanding.

Sorry that was all a BIG BIG mistake. When Karish broke the Trap the Soul
Gem we had no intention of hurting Musan. Dave, didn't Musan slip when he
came back and Daemon, trying to miss him as he stumbled forward, couldn't
help but roll the 19 which cut the head form Musan. Remember Dave we were
musing afterward that it was as if Musan threw his neck across the Vorpal
Axe. It was a slow motion event that everyone just stares at but no one has
the power to stop. We were all taken aback and Musan was taken ahead.

The murdered MU's name was Cicero and the evidence Kevin Supplied was
imcomplete and largelt in error.  I.E.  He was murdered for nothing
other than overactive paranoia for imagined causes.

John,
<p>
   Seriously though, if you get the chance, type in your account of
this story so I can add it to the archives.

Here goes.
<p>
     Ciecero had done something to piss off Karish. I think it simply had to
with Hurlee and the Horse Clans.
<p>
     Karisk with consultation with Gilmar decided to, at first, simply do
something to annoy Ciecero. With that thought in mind he decided to summon
an aerial servant and sent it to Ciecero and take his magic staff. What the
Staff did I do not remember and it couldn't have been much but Ciecero was
attached to it.
<p>
     The aerial servant went to Hurlee and did the job well returning with
the Staff. Of course Ciecero was pissed and vowed in the form of Cyril to
have vengeance.
<p>
     It was a week or so later that  Karish and Glimar were outside. Where I
don't remember when a huge Earth Elemental burst through the ground
surprized us, grabbed the mighty Staff of Kings and disappeared back into
the ground. Karish yelled aloud ( to the Dm and after checking the Summon
Elemental spell) that the summoner must be within a 16 radius to control the
Earth Elemental. Glimar whipped out the Gem of True Seeing and began to
quickly scan the area while Karish looks around with his 805 plus chance to
see invisible.  The DM looked confused and stated that Ciecero was still in
Hurlee. The Dm had failed to read the Summon Elemental spell and had
listened to Cieceroon how the spell worked. Apparently Ciecero had summoned
the Earth Elemental with no PFE in place which means the elemental would
immediately attempt to slay Ciecero and take his soul back to his home
elemental plane as a slave. The Dm advised that Ciecero had summoned the
Earth Elemental and simply bargained with it to get the Staff of Kings. We
BROW BEAT the DM into submission by legitimately and correctly insisting
that the rules for the spells be followed by all parties. The DM did a time
reversion and corrected the situation.
<p>
     Karish created the PFE 1"" radius amulets because he didn't want
Ciecero attempting the same thing to him again, and being a good buddy of
Glimar he made one for him also.
<p>
     karish was not impressed that Ciecero would have the audacity to
attempt to steal from him and decided to put an end to him.
<p>
     I used a scroll of Trap the Soul and placed it on the Staff from Cicero
as the trigger with the Soul GEm back in THE TOWER. I then gave the Staff to
a % level MU and sent him to challenge Ciecero in Hurlee. Ciecero summoned
an Earth Elemental correctly this time and sent it to destroy the MU with
the Staff, which deed was quickly accomplished. The Earth Elemental returned
with the Staff and presented it to Cyril. My insidious plan worked perfectly
as if the item is accepted voluntarily the subject receives no saving throw
and their physical body becomes imprisoned in the Soul Gem. So ended the
days of Ciecero.
<p>
     Not wanting to risk Ciecero rescue by the destruction of the Soul Gem
Karish and Glimar when to the Purple Mountain and visited Daemon. With
credit to Ciecero powers we placed 60 of Daemons body guards outside the
Room of Unsustainable Magic, Glimar, Daemon and I placed upon ourselves
every imaginable magic protection and ward and then enter ed the Room of
Unsustainable Magic.(Only magic in existence upon entering the room would
work new magic could not be created - Cicero than could not cast spells) (
We played this in the old orange room standing by the bar in the back right
hand corner.)
<p>
     Karish threw the Soul Gem to the floor and Cicero materialized. Daemon
swung the Vorpal Battle Axe ( as Cyril standing there say "Wait" but too
late as the d20 had already left my hand and was tumbling along the alcohol
stained bar top) the d20 ended on a 19 and off came the head of Cicero.
<p>
     That's the story to the best of my recollection.
