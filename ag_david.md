# David's Characters

These are the characters that were played by
David Janes during the Arthgar campaign.

## Glimar

Glimar is my primary character, who I played on an off during the
entire Arthgar campaign. He joined the group during our second session
to replace the unfortunate Elric. He started the campaign at level 2
and when we finished playing he was level 12.

</table>

### Other Attributes

The age is a guess, given that Glimar was 34 at level 8, and probably
would have achieved that level fairly early on, probably before the
end of the Third Age. Given that my notes say that Glimar was level 12
in 6 Fourth Age, he's probably 40 now.

## <a name="Elric">Elric</a>

This is my original character in Kevin's campaign.
I believe he lasted all of one session, whereupon he was killed by
the other group. As a historical curiosity, it was written on an
old "Dungeons & Dragons (R) Character Record" sheet, Copyright 1977 -
TSR Hobbies, Inc. It's an orange three-hole punch sheet loose-leaf.
How it survived this long is quite a mystery.
In the area where it asks for an (Sketch of Character Here),
I've drawn a little stick man with a paper hat on his head.
