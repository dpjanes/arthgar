<h1>Campaign Chronology</h1>
<div style="font-size: 10px; margin-left: 40px">
[<a href="index.html">Arthgar Home</a>]
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="wideblock">
<p>
The campaign we played from 1982 through '89 can essentially be divided into
four phases.
<p>
The first phase was the early days, leading from the Chagmat Dungeon through
to defeating Fashor the Black and killing his son.
We have extensive notes from this period, and quite frankly, this was
the period when we were having the most fun.
<p>
The second phase consisted of the invasion of Arthgar by the Northern
Barbarians, and a series of actions to stop the Black Council from
summoning the god Kas back to the Prime Material plane.
<p>
The third phase consisted of "armies", where John and Cyril controlled
various countries inside Arthgar.
The core characters of the campaign were (I believe) only peripherally
involved in this, if at all, and I did not play at all.
The rules for this were home grown.
<p>
The final phase consisted of Glimar and Karesh building The Tower
and trying to wrest control of Arthgar from the Black Council. In this
final phase we were joined by new characters played by Cyril, Steve Hart
and Joe Healy.
My Cedar character dropped out because the party had become too evil
for him and John's Daemon was up to running his own country.
At the end, the campaign was so magic intensive that there really wan't
any point in non-MUs being involved in most activities.
</div>

<h2>First Phase - Chagmat through Fashor</h2>
<div class="wideblock">
<p>
See the section
<a href="ag_early.html">Early Days</a> for more detailed notes about this time.
For reference purposes, we were playing at the Health Sciences Center
cafeteria in December, 1982 when we defeated Fashor.
Normally we played in either the Orange Room or the Thompson
Student Centre (TSC) cafeteria, depending on what had been booked.
The HSC had marginally better "food".
<p>
Here is a summary of events that happened in the first three months of
game play. Missing from this list is the adventure with the Spiders
in the great forest. I assume that this happened after Aracus' Tower,
but I'm not sure when.

<p>
    The epic battle between Daemon and the barbarian with the sword which
slays magic users forever, on the ice bridge between both armies, I had him
down to the single digits of HP's when he won initiative and killed me. One
of the few times Daemon died.

<p>
What was the name of the Barbarian from the North that Daemon
fought on the Bridge?

<p class="mailheader">
Cyril;
October 23, 1997
<p>
Was it Ragnar, that rings a bell.  You know how Kevin was right it
the Norse Mythos at that time.  Didn't John say that Daemon bit the big
one. He deserved it too, the Cyril MU murdering hairy stump thumper.

We really need to get a hold of Kevins notes etc so that we can put together
a proper campaign chronology with side notes, etc.

<p>
This information is from a phone conversation I had with Kevin on 23 Oct 97.

<p>
<ul>
<li> Fourth Age ended with the banishment of KAS (for another 1000 years)
<li> the BLACK COUNCIL was attempting to bring back demigod KAS -- sorta
  KAS partially on Prime Material Plane
  he did not have full power on PMP
  BC liked it that way, were only partially trying to bring him back
<li> BLACK COUNCIL is LE, KAS is CE
<li> KAS was to unleash all sorts of nasties from hidden dungeons

<h2>Diary</h2>
<div class="wideblock">
<p>
These are a few notes I had made in one of my books, made
in 1988.
<p>
[ SECTION 1 ]
<p>
June 18, _4248_ 4.A (_6_) 5.A.)<br>
[ I assume that this is Fourth Age and Fifth Age ]<br>
<p>
Somebody is impersonating Karish and Daemon and blasting up various towns, etc.
After a journey into the Great Forest, we got enough info from some _Phanx Spiders_
to scry on who was doing it --- some fighter/MU type dude under the pay of _Demoras_
and the _Barokian Council_. We found out that he was going to do the same trick in
_Daros_, so we went there and cut him off, but didn't kill him.
<p>
Meanwhile, at the end of that battle Karish and your humble narrator got a
Message from our tower that we were being attacked by that stupid
Druid [not Cedar!]. We teleported back, Karish cast a Fly spell on me,
and I went and fought him on his Chariot of Sunstar. A Chaos spell got
him, along with a fighter; and later a Blindness spell, and his own
Feeblemind (via a Ring of Spell Turning) [god love ya for all the Magic Items,
Kevin]. Cleric used Word of Recall to save himself and the Druid, and left
behind the two fighters, one who fell off, the other we hacked.
<p>
--- Cleric is from _Gelport_
--- Druid is from _Namacar_ and they are apparently unhappy with us
<p>
I remain, Glimar Glandolin
<p>
[ SECTION 2 ]
<p>
June 28, 6 F.A.<br>
<p>
Karish and I have decided to attack the Barokian Council,
soliciting some help from the others in the party. _Ziltch_
[Cyril's character?] had to charge some items, so I went down to
Phanx in the tower and scyred on various enemies. The Druid is
probably not going to try a solo attack (and is going to ask the
Great Druid for assistance!), the clerics of Gelport are asking
some Paladins for help --- ha! good luck. Meanwhile, the Barokian
Council are running away to their summer cabin (actually, a fortress)
down by _Turasak_. We are going to follow them down and give them
a welcoming committee.
<p>
( July 4, 6 FA )<br>
We used the mirror system to get to Phanx, where we continue via
Carpet south. We met up with raiders and followed them into a
mountain pass where we were attacked by a Cleric, a MU and the
raiders. The MU ran away and we killed the rest (getting the cleric
with a Power Word, Stun).
<p>
( July 10, 6 FA )<br>
Interlude with Clone.<br>
Karish's clone came into existance, so we teleported up to _Balanor's_
chamber where we waited for a week. Karish's clone committed suicide --
end of his story.
<p>
( July 12, 6 FA )<br>
Back down south, we go into that place where the MU (who is an Illusionist_)
hid. We blasted the door and went in. Ziltch was last and a theif attacked
him, but Z dispatched him with little trouble. We were attacked by Fire
Giants inside, whom we hacked up. We used Emotion (Hopelessness) to take
one prisoner, and found out about the place. I scryed on the MU and he
knew we were coming. He had a similar scyring device and used it on us
[ the nerve ] stopping us from finding out more info. Anyway, to make a
long story short, we blasted them (58 giants, 3 MU-illusionists) A room
sucked up Karish's Amulet of Cold when he went after a few more MUs.
<p>
( Aug 8 )<br>
Went to silly place with 4 keys. John lost his vorporal axe.
<p>
( Aug 8 )<br>
Discovered Joe's spies.
