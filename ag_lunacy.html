I think this is illustrative of the shift from Players <i>vs.</i>
NPCs to Us <i>vs.</i> the DM.

     You guys weren't around for this little adventure. <p>Karish was
travelling by boat on a river, can't remember where, with a crew of minor
MU's and fighters. I was sleeping when there was  aloud commotion and I was
awaked by a MU to hurry to the deck. Crawling on board the boat was a huge
 8 headed water hydra, chewing up the fighters. I looked at Kevin and say "I
cast power word kill" Karish says "Die" and the 8 headed hydra falls back
into the water dead, the crew and the MU's look on in amazement. Karish says
"don't wake me for this kind of thing again"

     Where were we when we meet up with a projection Lord Oogar , Captain of
the Black Riders, in some dungeon. There was this weird altar in a room
which we didn't enter and all of a sudden he appeared. As usual we taunted
him and made illusions of us dancing all all the altar. He tried to fireball
us and we just closed the door on him and laughed.
<p>
     There was also the other incident when Karish and Glimar killed a
assassin(?) in some battle by a woods. Being the magic scavengers that we
were karish took Glimar and the body to the ethereal plane so we could pick
the body clean. Kevin got all excited as he could roll his fixed dice and
generate a wandering ethereal monster. It was classic Karish and Glimar. A
Ghost approached we both roll saves vs. aging in the open and with our
Protection from Evil 1'' radius the Ghost could not touch us. Karisk looks
up from the picking of the body and states "Go away or we shall kill you"
The Ghost recognizing our power decided to leave. Classic.
<p>
     How about Kevin racking his brains for a method of having Type V demons
annoy Karish. Lets pscionically link three of them together to boost their
and their range. Works well until we find them. Then meat..

The encounter with a slave train of the Black Council shortly after we
joined and remained members of for about a whole day. Karish that day didn't
like slavery so he ordered the slaves released. the leader refused, Karish
disintigrated him. As his troops looked on with his lieutenats by his side a
pile of arms and armour fell to the ground from atop his horse. The slaves
were released.
<p>
The teleportation of those 12' high immune to everything creatures that
Kevin created to try and kill Karish. The DM laughed as we looked out form
the top of the Tower through the glasteel wall, as the creatures destroyed
our servants. We did a project image and tried to do some damage to no
effect. The creatures teleported in to the room. Kevin states "These 2 12' -
13'  creatures materialize in front of you. Hahahahaha... I pull out the
Tower design hahahahahaha the ceiling is only 10' high, ...hahahahaha "You
mean two lifeless, headless bleeding corpses fall to our feet"<p> "Cleaning
staff, remove this mess."

     I think you are wrong. The Akars didn't come into the picture for quite
a while. Glimmer was at least 10th level when he became their exalted
undying figurehead.

  I didn't mean to imply that we had met the Akars that early, just that they and the Black Council and the Akars were
both from the same location (I think).

I don't know where the majority of my stuff has disappeared. By the way
either there is an error on Glimars sheet re:experience or also you typed it
in wrong. He has to have more than 85000. More likely 850,000.  Dave Glimar
has more than the more than the maximum possible HP's. Explain that one O
Lord of the Akars, He Who Has Gone Travelling While His Corporeal Body Lies
Smoldering.

<h2>Hit Points</h2>
<div class="wideblock">
<p>
The following section demonstrates that you'll never get an even break,
even for a simple typing mistake. On the other hand, Glimar was
occasionally played as if he had twenty-thousand hit points.

19,500 HP. That's an awful lot of HP's. Sounds like one of Kevin's monsters
specifically generated to kill Karish.

<h2>The Staff of Kings</h2>
<div class="wideblock">
<p>
In the interests of preserving game balance, given
handed out this little goody to John.
Essentially, it was a high power flamethrower that
weighed about 15 pounds and didn't need to be refilled ever.

<li> what were Cyril's character's names and types
<li> what were we doing when we discovered the staff of kings
